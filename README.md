# What to know:
i did use ai for the background tunnel effect and on the silence system detection so when the song is playing silent parts does not do spawn notes etc

# How to setup & What to know extra:

extract from .zip into a folder. move all files into that folder and create a folder along side of em named "saves" and put the json im there

The .json is the map of the song that auto generates and re-uses same map each time unless you delete the .json if it cant find it, it will make a new one.
The spiral notes [Spiral Events] arte luck based. has 20% chance to spawn and 30% Spiral Chain Event to continue the first spiral up to 2 (later ill make it up to 3 its easy to set it tbh),
During Spiral Events no regular note is gonna spawn because i dont know how to make it stop from spitting ton of notes all of a sudden 
Any .MP3 & .WAV file can be played there no difference between generations of the map process

The notes may speed up by 10% after 50 hit-combo. 
The notes also may speed up by itself or slowdown based on adaptive bpm i have added if im not mistaken it should work somewhat

Tunnel effect/Fever event is activated at 25 hit-combo and must be maintainbed over 5 seconds for the tunnel effect to kick-in if not it cancels

Pressing R will kick you to menu....welll instead it crashes the game its broken as well as ESC xd

HP will reduce if a hit is miss. Without fever event you heal by 1x if there's an active fever event you'll heal by 2x +2hp per note

# Current in-game events:

Fever Events: Triggered when 25X Combo reached
Tunnel Event: Triggered when after 25X Comnbo Maintained Over 5 Seconds
Spiral Note Events: Triggered after 200 Notes. Has 20% To Spawn an Spiral Event for Every 10 Note Hitted
Spiral Chain Events: Activates Only During a Spiral Event. Each Spiral's Last Note Has a 30% Chance to Call yet Another Spiral Event (Stacks up to 2. In Total you can get up to 3 Spirals at once)

# Will the " project " receive more updates?

Probaby yes such as overall optimization other than that i don't think so. I might try to add the requests tho if there is any OR feel free to modify and add things to it so we have some kind of community update thingy

[Both spawn animations idea & Hit timer was added by a request from @jiggly.balls] (yes thats his name xd)
